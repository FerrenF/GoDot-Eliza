 A Godot Implementation of JB's 1966 Eliza Chatbot

A modern reimagining of the classic chatbot ELIZA, implemented using the GoDot game engine. Dive into a world of questionable therapy sessions with our pixelated art style and soothing background music. Don't use this as an actual therapy device if you need help - you are worth more than that. J.W. was mad about that too.

## Features
![preview2.png](preview2.png)
- **Classic ELIZA Experience**: Engage in conversation with ELIZA, a chatbot designed to mimic a Rogerian psychotherapist, offering reflective responses based on your input.
  
- **Pixelated Art Style**: Immerse yourself in a retro-inspired visual environment, where ELIZA is personified as a therapist in a 2D therapy room, and you play the role of the patient.

- **Background Music**: Enjoy chilled lo-fi ambient background music designed to draw out the profound.

- **Interactive Menu**: Access various options through a standard menu interface, complete with animations and pixel art elements.

- **Future Developments**:
  - **Algorithm Tracing**: Explore ELIZA's decision-making process through a separate tab within the chatbox.
  - **Animated ELIZA**: Experience enhanced interaction with animated responses from ELIZA.
  - **Script Loading**: Load additional scripts using the original formatting devised by Joseph Weizenbaum, the creator of ELIZA.
